Description=<b>This plugin punishes players that camp too long.</b><br> Camping is a strategy, no doubt about it. However, like most things in life, it's best done in moderation. That's why Bad Camper exists. It allows players to camp but encourages them to not pitch a tent. <br>There can be a combination of punishments that get applied to a player that camps too long. Punishments start when the player's camping meter reaches 80%. They get worse at 90%. They finally come to a crescendo at 100%.
