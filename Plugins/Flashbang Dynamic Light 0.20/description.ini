Description=<b>adds a touch of realism to flashbangs, having them give off a dynamic light upon explosion.</b><br> Requested by NemesisDelta. <br>Note that for the purpose of showcasing the dynamic light effect, the ScreenFade message was blocked in the video. However, in actual use, you will still get blinded by a flashbang just as always; the light is meant more to be seen around corners and such.
